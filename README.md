# Primary Objective
This project’s primary objective is to provide users a convenient way of finding great recipe suggestions for their everyday meals. Additionally, it shall provide a meal-planning feature which will help them create a better routine and save time.

# Secondary Objectives

| Objective  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Fully functional user authentication system  | The user is able to create an account and use it to log in on the web application. Only a username and a password will be required to create the account. The functionality is implemented using  Firebase.  |
| Relevant and up-to-date recipe database | The user will have access to a wide range of recipes. This will be accomplished through the periodical update of the database by the application maintainer(s), as well as through the user’s ability to add recipes to the main recipe database.  |
| Recipe search  | The user will be able to search through the app’s database using the ingredient keywords.  |
| Recipe categorical Browsing  | The user will be able to browse through the recipes of a selected category (i.e. dinner, lunch, breakfast).  |
| Random recipe  suggestion feature  | The user will be able to generate recipe suggestions based on their history of recipes used.   |
| Meal-Plan generation  | The user will be able to generate meal plans consisting of three meals for a set number of days.  |

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
